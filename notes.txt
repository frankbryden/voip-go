finally got an initial version working.
Can hear myself speak, voice is transmitted correctly.
2 issues first of all:
 - audio quality is terrible, choppy is the main issue
 - stream falls waaayy behind. Buffers fill up I guess as delay between voice recorded and voice played increases as time goes on
Very exciting nonetheless!

ok wow this is insane, just increasing the buffer size of mic data from 64 to 256 bytes fixes all the aforementioned issues.
